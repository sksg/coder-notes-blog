[{"content":"Let me start this first post by explaining a little about what to expect on this site.\nI am not a professional programmer. In fact, I have never finished any significant piece of software outside of small, closed circles. I am a physicist. And I have written loads of one-off analysis softwares within mathematics, physics, and computer vision. I like programming. I enjoy trying new programming languages, just to see if they are more suited for various tasks. And until a few years ago, I though the makings of a new programming languages were pure magic.\nQuite a few years later, I stumbled onto one of Jon Blows presentations about Jai1: A Programming Language for Games. It occurred to me: perhaps building my own language is not completely impossible. And so I began planning my own programming language. I have not yet done any significant work on that except test interpreters.\nFinally, I stumbled upon a task more suitable to begin with; a human friendly file format (hfff), which I hope to dive into. It is a data format like 2, 3 or 4. On the surface it is not very different, perhaps a little simpler but also more restrictive. However, diving into the details it is much more concise and straigforward, without the many pitfalls of the other data formats. I really believe in this and so I will start documenting my research and progress here on this site.\nBlow, Jonathan, 2014, A Programming Language for Games, accessed 06 September 2021, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nJavaScript Object Notation, accessed 03 July 2023, https://www.json.org/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTom\u0026rsquo;s Obvious Minimal Language, accessed 03 July 2023, https://toml.io/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nYAML Ain\u0026rsquo;t Markup Language, accessed 03 July 2023, https://yaml.org/spec/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://sksg.github.io/codespeak/post/first-post/","summary":"Let me start this first post by explaining a little about what to expect on this site.\nI am not a professional programmer.
