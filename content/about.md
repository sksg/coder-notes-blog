# About

My name is Søren K.S. Gregersen. I am an engineer schooled in physics and nanotechnology. I tried pursuing an academic career in nano electronics and later computer vision (see my old work at [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?hl=da&pli=1&user=MUqqiF8AAAAJ)). Now, however, I am employed as a imaging systems engineer in the medical industry. I consider myself a more-than-a-hobbyist programmer with many unfinished projects (see my random code at [Github](https://github.com/sksg)).

# About this blog

This is where I collect my general thoughts on programming, languages, tools, and frameworks. But mostly, it is where I explore the development of my toy-language ∨∑ (orsum).
