Let me start this first post by explaining a little about what to expect on this site.

I am not a professional programmer. In fact, I have never finished any significant piece of software outside of small, closed circles. I am a physicist. And I have written loads of one-off analysis softwares within mathematics, physics, and computer vision. I like programming. I enjoy trying new programming languages, just to see if they are more suited for various tasks. And until a few years ago, I though the makings of a new programming languages were pure magic.

Quite a few years later, I stumbled onto one of Jon Blows presentations about Jai[^BlowVideos]: A Programming Language for Games. It occurred to me: perhaps building my own language is not *completely* impossible. And so I began planning my own programming language. I have not yet done any significant work on that except test interpreters.

Finally, I stumbled upon a task more suitable to begin with; a human friendly file format (hfff), which I hope to dive into. It is a data format like [^JSON], [^TOML] or [^YAML]. On the surface it is not very different, perhaps a little simpler but also more restrictive. However, diving into the details it is much more concise and straigforward, without the many pitfalls of the other data formats. I really believe in this and so I will start documenting my research and progress here on this site.
